This is a read me, oh boy. 

Welcome, this is my personal website that I will be linking my main projects from and my own personal blog. 

 as of right now this is still currently under development, but I would like to take sometime to piont out what I've done and some of the foundational decisions
 that I have made. 

 First, this is buit with create React app, but with most if not all of the boiler removed, it is not ejected "yet" but it is something that I may end up doing in the future. 

 Second, yes I decided to scroll lock the site, I know that this is not really everyones cup of tea, but I felt for my own purposes and the way I designed the code it made expanding the site much easier. Each page has it's own wrapper that handles state and reduces the need to handle states on a single static page to enable and disable componants rerendering. 

 My hope is that you enjoy the site and find that it is a good resource to access all of my on going coding endevours.
